# Ballance Package Manager

A ~~*awful*~~ package manager for Ballance.

## Progress

**Project-alice-in-wonderland** has been done because I have solved the major issues of deploying.

**Project-ChickenFork** \(sto omniscient jx\) will seperate the bpm kernel and the user interface for multi-platform development. This is a hard work.

When I finish this project, you can see a clear construction of this repo. This repo have BPMServer and BPMKerner for the base and SharedLib for the communication. And BPMShamrock\(A Windows GUI client under .Net Framework 4 to adjust Ballance running environment.\) and BPMClover\(A cross-platform console app using .Net Core 2.x/3.x\) will use BPMKerner to implemen their function.
