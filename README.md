# Ballance Package Manager

A ~~*awful*~~ package manager for Ballance.

## Progress

**Project-Operation-Crossroads** has been done. Now, bpm can run on the OS which have .Net Core support.

We have entered **Project-Slime**'s development. Why use this project name? First, this stage's coding work is a hardship. It just like silme. It is not easy to deal with because we need to consider the real deploy. We even need to re-construct the whole kernel. ~~Second, I watch [*That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That_Time_I_Got_Reincarnated_as_a_Slime) recently. リムル・テンペスト最高ですね~~

## Todo list

What we need to do in this project:

* Full support and stable runtime C\# code compile
* Merge BPMSMaintenance into BPMServer
* Provide a detailed script development & user document
* Internal universal pre-compile script feature \(For more fluent and easier script bug fix\)
* ...
